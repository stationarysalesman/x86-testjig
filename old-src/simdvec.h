/* [1]. On memory alignment, SIMD vectors, and malloc(): 
 * 
 * Yes, the C99 standard says malloc() mustreturn a pointer "suitably
 * aligned so that it may be aligned to a pointer of any type of
 * object" (C99 7.20.3). Yes, __m128 vectors are 16 bytes. Yes, you'd
 * think malloc() ought to be required return a pointer aligned on a
 * 16-byte boundary. But, no, malloc() doesn't have to do this;
 * malloc() will return improperly aligned memory on many systems.
 * Reason: vectors are officially considered "out of scope" of the C99
 * language.
 * 
 * So vector memory has to be manually aligned. For 16-byte alignment,
 * the idiom looks like the following, where for any to-be-aligned
 * ptr, we first allocate a raw (unaligned) memory space that's 15
 * bytes larger than we need, then set the aligned ptr into that space;
 * and when we free, we free the raw memory ptr:
 * 
 *   raw_mem = malloc(n + 15);
 *   ptr     = (__m128 *) ( ((uintptr_t) raw_mem + 15) & (~0xf));
 *   
 * To allow for arbitrary byte alignment (e.g. AVX), instead of
 * hard-coding 16-byte alignment with constants 15 and 0xf, we use
 * p7_VALIGN, (p7_VALIGN-1) and p7_VALIMASK.
 * 
 * Technically, the result of casting a non-NULL pointer to an integer
 * type is undefined (C99 6.3.2.3), but this idiom for manual memory
 * alignment is in widespread use so seems generally safe.
 * 
 * See also: posix_memalign(), as an alternative.
